# Hand-Gesture
Robots are controlled using hand gesture because robots
need a helping hand whether it may be any function, without
human robots cannot be operated. The main purpose of
using hand gestures is that it provides a more schematic
way of controlling the robot and with this feature robot can
be used as a wheelchair or as a spy robot or for vigilance. As
human hand gestures are natural, with the help of wireless
communication, it is easier to interact with the robot in a
more-friendly way. The robotâ€™s movement depends on the
gestures made by hand. The objective of this paper is to
build a wireless, hand gesture controlled robot using an
Arduino Uno, an accelerometer, and a RF transmitter and a
RF receiver set. The Arduino Uno microcontroller reads the
analog output values i.e., x-axis and y-axis values of the
accelerometer and converts that analog value to respective
digital value. The values are given a specific function by the
use of the Arduino software. The digital values are processed
by the Arduino Uno microcontroller and according to the tilt
of the accelerometer sensor mounted on the hand, it sends
the commands to the RF transmitter which sends the signal
to the receiver and there these signals are processed by the
receiver end which drives the motor to a particular direction
in which we have set it to move. The robot moves forward,
backward, right and left when we tilt our palm to forward,
backward, right and left respectively and the robot stops
when our palm is parallel to the ground.
